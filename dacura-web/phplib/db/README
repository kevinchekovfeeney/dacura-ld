This directory is for classes which access the DB. 

All access to DBs (SQL) MUST be put in these classes to ease future migration to RDF 

The DBManager class provides core DB access services that are used by multiple dacura services

DB accesses that are only used by a particular service are factored out into classes that extend and inherit the DBManager Class.  

Separating the DB access out like this minimises the amount of code that has to be loaded for each service.
