Mathews was burned to death during an intense gunfight with sixty to five hundred law enforcement agents who surrounded his house south of Coupeville, Washington on Whidbey Island on December 8, 1984.\nMathews was surrounded in a house south of Coupeville, Washington on Whidbey Island by government agents on December 8, 1984. (Various sources state numbers of law enforcement agents between 60 and 500). Mathews refused to come out after an intense exchange of gunfire. The FBI then fired dozens of smoke grenades into the house in an attempt to force Mathews out, but he was wearing a protective mask. They then decided to fire several M-79 Starburst flares inside the house, setting off a box of hand grenades and a stockpile of ammunition. Mathews continued to fire at agents as the house burned, but then suddenly stopped. After the wreckage had cooled enough to be searched, agents found the burned remains of Mathews' body next to a charred bathtub with the gold symbol of his order melted into his chest.","startdate":"1984-12-15 12:00:00","enddate":"1984-12-15 12:00:00","date_display":"month","link":"http:\/\/dacura.cs.tcd.ie\/data\/politicalviolence\/uspv\/E100","importance":40,"icon":"political.png"},{"id":"E848","title":"riot","description":"Motivation: race<br>Location: Birmingham, KY<br>Fatalities: 2<br><br>March: About 100 Night Riders raided three black homes, intending to whip blacks and drive them out of the state.

Kane Jr., 45, of Forest, Ohio, and his son Joseph T. Kane killed 2 policemen, Sgt. Brandon Paudert, 39, and Officer Bill Evans, 38, with AK-47 assault rifles. Later they were killed by police.\nIn addition, Sheriff Dick Busby and Deputy Chief W.A. Wren were wounded. The tragic day began at 11:36 a.m. on Interstate 40 when Evans radioed in that he was pulling over a white minivan with Ohio license plates near mile marker 275. The van pulled off the interstate onto an off-ramp near College Boulevard. A few minutes later, Paudert, Evans' backup in the Criminal Interdiction Unit, arrived on the scene. Suddenly, one of the two suspects in the van wrestled Evans to the ground. Gunfire rang out toward both officers from a \"long rifle\" and a handgun, police said. Somehow, and police aren't sure exactly how, a broadcast went out at 11:50 a.m.: \"Officer down.\" Chief Paudert, answering his phone on the scene shortly after the shooting, confirmed that his son was dead. Evans was airlifted to Regional Medical Center at Memphis, where he was was pronounced dead. That sparked a massive manhunt by every law enforcement agency in the area, including Memphis and Shelby County, in case the subjects fled across the river. At about 1:06 p.m., someone spotted the van in the parking lot of the West Memphis Walmart. What happened next is still the subject of confusion, one of many things investigators with the Arkansas State Police will have to decipher. Dozens of shots rang out, both from the two suspects and the officers, but investigators are uncertain exactly who fired. Busby and Wren were hit, with Busby taking a shot in the shoulder and Wren taking three in the abdomen. At that point, an unknown wildlife officer with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, part of the manhunt, rammed his pickup into the side of the minivan, disabling it. \"If it hadn't been for him, they'd probably have killed Wren and Busby outright,\" said Al Boals, a former West Memphis mayor visiting the family at The Med. More than 30 officers swarmed the van after the shootout. The suspects' bodies were pulled out, then thrown on a grassy median and the parking lot.","startdate":"2010-05-15 12:00:00","enddate":"2010-05-15 12:00:00","date_display":"month","link":"http:\/\/dacura.cs.tcd.ie\/data\/politicalviolence\/uspv\/E1215","importance":40,"icon":"political.png"},{"id":"E86","title":"lynching","description":"Motivation: race<br>Location: Belmont, AL<br>Fatalities: 1<br><br>September: Black man held in jail as a result of 1870 crisis over blacks arming.
