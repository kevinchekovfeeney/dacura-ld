Quasi-polity is defined as a cultural area with some degree of cultural (including linguistic, if known) homogeneity that is distinct from surrounding areas. For example, the Marshall Islands before German occupation had no overarching native or colonial authority (chiefs controlled various subsets of islands and atolls) and therefore it was not a polity. But it was a quasi-polity because of the significant cultural and linguistic uniformity. The idea is to collect data for the quasi-polity as a whole. This way we can integrate over (often patchy) data from different sites and different polities to estimate what a 'generic' polity was like. Accordingly, when coding, for example, social complexity variables, enter data not for the whole NGA but for a 'typical' polity in it. For example, when coding for a quasi-polity polity territory is not the area of the NGA as a whole, but the average or typical area of polities within the NGA." } }, "seshattiny:InterestGroup": { "rdf:type": "owl:Class", "rdfs:subClassOf": "seshattiny:Organisation", "rdfs:label": { "lang": "en", "data": "Interest group" }, "rdfs:comment": { "lang": "en", "data": "An Interest Group(IG) is a social group that pursues some common interest, so that its members are united by a common goal or goals.
