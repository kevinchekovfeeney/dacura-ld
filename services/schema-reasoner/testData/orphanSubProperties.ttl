sghd:SovereignOrganisation a owl:Class;

	rdfs:label "sovereign organisation";
	rdfs:comment "A derived concept covering human social groups with some self-governing powers.".

	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:SovereignOrganisation;
	rdfs:label "sub-polity";
	rdfs:comment "A derived concept covering human social groups that are temporal, geographic or political components of other human social groups.".

sghd:Polity a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:SovereignOrganisation;
	rdfs:label "polity";
	rdfs:comment "A polity is defined as an independent political unit. Kinds of polities range from villages (local communities) through simple and complex chiefdoms to states and empires. A polity can be either centralized or not (e.g., organized as a confederation). What distinguishes a polity from other human groupings and organizations is that it is politically independent of any overarching authority; it possesses sovereignty. Polities are defined spatially by the area enclosed within a boundary on the world map. There may be more than one such areas. Polities are dynamical entities, and thus their geographical extent may change with time. Thus, typically each polity will be defined by a set of multiple boundaries, each for a specified period of time. For prehistoric periods and for NGAs populated by a multitude of small-scale polities we use a variant called quasi-polity.".

sghd:QuasiPolity a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:SovereignOrganisation;
	rdfs:label "quasi-polity";
	rdfs:comment " The polity-based approach is not feasible for those periods when a NGA is divided up among a multitude of small-scale polities (e.g., independent villages or even many small chiefdoms). In this instance we use the concept of 'quasi-polity'. Similarly, for societies known only archaeologically we may not be able to establish the boundaries of polities, even approximately. Quasi-polity is defined as a cultural area with some degree of cultural (including linguistic, if known) homogeneity that is distinct from surrounding areas. For example, the Marshall Islands before German occupation had no overarching native or colonial authority (chiefs controlled various subsets of islands and atolls) and therefore it was not a polity. But it was a quasi-polity because of the significant cultural and linguistic uniformity. The idea is to collect data for the quasi-polity as a whole. This way we can integrate over (often patchy) data from different sites and different polities to estimate what a 'generic' polity was like. Accordingly, when coding, for example, social complexity variables, enter data not for the whole NGA but for a 'typical' polity in it. For example, when coding for a quasi-polity polity territory is not the area of the NGA as a whole, but the average or typical area of polities within the NGA.".

sghd:InterestGroup a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:UnitOfSocialOrganisation;
	rdfs:label "interest group";
	rdfs:comment "An Interest Group(IG) is a social group that pursues some common interest, so that its members are united by a common goal or goals. Polities and religious cults are also interest groups, but the IG category is broader. It also includes ethnic groups, professional associations, warrior bands, solidarity associations, mutual aid societies, firms and banks (including their premodern variants), etc. The IG is defined sociologically, not geographically. However, if desired, a geographic area, enclosed within a boundary, may be associated with it in the same way as with a polity or a  Religious System(RS). ".

sghd:ReligiousSystem a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:InterestGroup;
	rdfs:label "religious system";
	rdfs:comment "Religious System (RS). This unit is defined in ways that are analogous to a polity, except it reflects religious, rather than political authority. Religious systems are dynamical and are typically defined by a set of dated boundaries. Unlike polities, religious systems often overlap with each other.".

sghd:City a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:UnitOfSocialOrganisation;
	rdfs:label "city";
	rdfs:comment "Cities are represented by a single point on the map that doesn’t change with time. Although it is possible to reflect their spatial expansion dynamically, we chose not to do so in the current implementation.".

sghd:FreeFormArea a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:UnitOfTerritory;
	rdfs:label "free form area";
	rdfs:comment "Freeform area (FA). This is an area enclosed within a boundary, or a dated set of boundaries. Basically, it is our method for treating an arbitrary shape on the map to which a historical expert wishes to tie certain values of coded variables. Examples include a province within an empire, something with a hole in it, or a ‘southeast corner of a region.".

sghd:NaturalGeographicArea a owl:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf sghd:UnitOfTerritory;
	rdfs:label "natural geographic area";
	rdfs:comment "Natural Geographic Region (NGA). This type of unit is defined spatially by the area enclosed within a boundary drawn on the world map. It does not change with time. Its rough spatial scale is 100 km × 100 km (+/- 50%). Examples: Latium, Upper Egypt, Middle Yellow River Valley. ".
